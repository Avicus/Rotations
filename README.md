## Avicus Rotations

This repository stores map rotations for the servers on The Avicus Network. Each file listed under the "servers" directory corresponds to a server on Avicus and contains the sequence of maps for that server.

### Suggesting Rotation Changes

Community members may propose rotation changes using either **Issues** or **Pull Requests**, although for organizational purposes, Issues are preferred. 

When proposing changes, please keep in mind that all changes should be detailed in the Issue or Pull Request's description, and make sure that they are consistent with the servers' allowed gamemodes. The **Destroy** server runs **DTC** and **DTM** maps, the **Capture** server runs **CTW** maps, the Conquest server runs **TDM**, **KoTH** & **CTF** maps, and finally the Walls server only runs **Walls** maps.

New servers/gamemodes are **not** to be suggested here for proposed gamemode rotations. Instead, use the [forums](http://avicus.net/forums) for your ideas.
